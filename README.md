## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

I created this tutorial to provide an introduction to working with the Coinmarketcap API. 

Here's why:
* Coinmarketcap's API offers access to extensive data and up to the minute prices of cryptocurrencies
* It also offers price histories and even graphs. (The tutorial does not cover these)


### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* Python 3.9 preferred
